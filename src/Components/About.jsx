        Sanaa is an e-commerce platform designed to host classic art peices. It
        seeks to bridge the gap between local and international artists and
        their customers. It provides a platform for them to interact and buy and
        sell their art pieces without the need for a middle-man, thus promoting
        the artists and providing a safe platform for transaction between the
        artists and the buyers.
